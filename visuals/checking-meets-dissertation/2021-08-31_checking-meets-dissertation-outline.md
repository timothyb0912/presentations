# Checking models in statistics, machine learning, and discrete choice

## A perspective to bind us all

<!-- Note that the imagery in my mind for the subtitle is the Lord of the Rings,
   "One Ring to bring them all and in the darkness bind them" -->

## Thanks

- Choice Modelling Centre at University of Leeds
- Everyone for taking time out of their day to attend or watch this seminar.

<!-- Perhaps we can simply reuse the slide from last time
(with any appropriate font changes if / as needed) -->

## What motivates the disciplinary mix? (problems)

- Hard and complex choice problems being faced in industry
  - choice of words, e.g. content-generation/support-chatbot, huggingface.co
  - choice of location, e.g. yelp
  - choice of clothing, e.g. stitchfix

<!-- Perhaps three sets of image/icon pairs?
Something generic for word/location/clothing + corporate icons next to it? -->

---

## What motivates the disciplinary mix? (opportunities)

- All quantitative disciplines now interested in modeling (various) choices

There is money to be made by accurately modelling choices,
so all quantitative disciplines have joined the party.

<!-- maybe an image of money partying? -->

---

## What motivates the disciplinary mix? (questions)

- Immediate and interesting questions are:
  - how to adapt 'non-choice-specific' quantitative methods to choice modelling?
  - how to promote and permit diversity, that is,
    how to understand, appreciate, and assess unfamiliar adaptations?

<!-- Maybe two images. One for adaptation / overcoming functional-fixedness.
   Another to represent diversity. -->

---

## How did my dissertation contribute? (Overall)

By pattern modelling. Demonstrating an adaptation strategy of
- starting with a
  - substantive choice modelling problem and
  - unsolved, technical problem with current choice models
- interesting quantitative ideas from outside of choice modelling
- customizing the
  - microeconomic interpretation / generation / recreation of the methods
  - implementation of general idea
    to ameliorate the technical choice modelling problem

<!-- I imagine three images with captions.
  A big pot/bowl for cooking soup or a cauldron.
  Caption = choice modelling problem.

  Some spices. Caption = outside idea.

  Spoon. Caption = choice modelling implementation. -->

## How did my dissertation contribute? (Statistics)

- pot/cauldron = low percentage of bicyclists
- spice = asymmetric link functions
- spoon = multinomial implementation

<!-- I'm imagining three images with caption (use wording above).
   pot = arrow-down, percentage sign, bicycle image
   spice = two links where one is or is made much longer than the other
   spoon = N > 2
 -->

## How did my dissertation contribute? (Machine Learning)

- pot/cauldron = non-compensatory bicycle choice behavior
- spice = decision trees
- spoon = bayesian model trees

<!-- I'm imagining three images with caption (use wording above).
   pot = drake [meme](https://external-content.duckduckgo.com/iu/?u=https%3A%2F%2Ftse1.mm.bing.net%2Fth%3Fid%3DOIP.ujpgnl14FmLIiCaomE7WgQAAAA%26pid%3DApi&f=1) where no = car and yes = bicycle
   spice = a decision tree image/icon such as https://clipground.com/images/decision-tree-clipart-4.png
   spoon = perhaps the words Bayes overlaid on an image of a 'model tree' such as http://preview.turbosquid.com/Preview/2014/05/21__00_30_15/tree_stvol8.jpgd2c63fd7-89b4-462e-8426-a15e639ad48fOriginal.jpg

## How did my dissertation contribute? (Causal Inference)

- pot/cauldron = (bicycle-infrastructure) intervention goals
- spice = causal graphical models
- spoon = latent variable modelling (and suggesting of)

<!-- I'm imagining three images with caption (use wording above).
   pot = aerial street design image
   spice = small causal graph image (see https://cicero.xyz/v3/remark/0.14.0/github.com/timothyb0912/presentations/stable/visuals/how-not-to-integrate-ml-and-dcm/2021-03-19_how-not-to-integrate-ml-and-dcm.md/#38)
   spoon = "ICLV connections" with ICLV in a cool font?

## How have the topics aged? (Overall)

- Relevance/usefulness of ideas remain
- Choice modelling opportunities remain

---

## How have the topics aged? (The Bad)

- Usage of custom link functions of any kind appears low.
- Trees not used with any general econometric interpretations.
- Causal graphical models not being widely used and investigated.

---

## How have the topics aged? (The Good)

- Neural network research in choice modelling is accelerating and primarily
  focusing attention on the index function rather than the link function.
  At least some exercise is happening
  (it's like working out one arm or leg but not the other).
- Foundational / enabling work is happening in
  machine learning, statistics, and causal inference
  - with trees (uncertainty-quantification + continuous-optimization)
  - with causal graphical models (continuous-optimization + theory)

## How to make sense of it all? (original)

- Learn + Translate all three fields? -> No.

---

## How to make sense of it all? (modern)

- Simulation-based model checking
  (competing analogies w/ most-preferred first, though both are accurate):
  - Listen to a constant soloist against varying choirs.
    Reality is the constant soloist.
    Each model brings its own chorus of simulated realities.
    Assess differences in how each chorus harmonizes with reality's soloist.
  - Look at a common picture under varying lights.
    View reality before a backdrop of model simulations from any field's models.

## Recap and future directions

- hard problems + fiscal opportunity is driving stats + ML + choice modelling
- lets welcome stats and machine learning via creations of
  pot-of-soup + spice + spoon.
- use model-checking to understand the modeling creations that we cook up.
