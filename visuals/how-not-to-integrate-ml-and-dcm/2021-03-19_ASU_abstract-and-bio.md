# When machines don't learn

## Common reasons for failed integrations between machine learning and discrete choice

Speaker: Dr. Timothy Brathwaite

## Abstract

Are you interested in machine learning?
Are you interested in how humans make choices?
Perhaps you've become excited about the idea of combining
machine learning and discrete choice models?
That's great, and the combination can sometimes work wonderfully.

Or... it can fail to produce anything deemed of econometric value.
This talk will NOT be about the newest,
latest, and greatest combination of ML and discrete choice.
Instead, this talk helps you prevent the all-too common experience of failure.
It is about the many ways that combining ML and discrete choice can go wrong,
and methods to avoid these pitfalls.

This talk draws on five years of professional experience,
eight years of research experience,
and thousands of hours of reading,
to reveal four common errors, any of which can ensure that
no matter how many (multiple) choices we give them,
the machines never learn.


## Bio

Timothy Brathwaite, PhD, is a data scientist at Stitch Fix Inc.
He is responsible for matching stylists and clients,
so individuals receive merchandise that they love.
Prior to Stitch Fix, he was a research scientist at Lyft,
working with the locations,
the estimated-time-of-arrival (ETA),
and the bikes-and-scooters teams.

He completed his PhD in transportation engineering
in the Civil and Environmental Engineering department
at the University of California at Berkeley,
working under the mentorship of Professor Joan Walker.

His research blended machine learning and statistical techniques
with discrete choice models
to predict the demand for bicycling under alternative policy scenarios.
For this work, he was awarded the 2018 Eric Pas Dissertation Prize.

Previously, he received his Master of City Planning and
Master of Science in Civil Engineering from UC Berkeley.
