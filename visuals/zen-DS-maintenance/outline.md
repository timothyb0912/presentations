# Outline

- thanks for coming to my last hurrah.
- title.
- sub-title
- why mental resilience, why me, why now?
- why me: throwback to blood-pressure graphs
- why now: current DS context:
  - visual:between the two horns of a bull like Phaedrus.
      - long-term, speculative, careful & thorough scientific work
        - we love
        - product and business may dislike much more than us
      - short-term, immediate, ad-hoc & barebones
        - product and business may like much more than us
        - we may generally prefer to do less of this work
      - both options someone is unhappy,
        and the change is a change of WHAT we do
      - As Phaedrus notes, however, every dilemma affords not two but three refutations.
        As visual, trace path through the two horns of the bull.
        In this case, we can change not WHAT we do but HOW we do.
  - problem:
    We are currently leaning towards second horn of bull,
    where stress may be high.
    We cannot return to first horn---
    investors may rebel against uncertainty.
  - solution (high level, general perspective):
    > Peace of mind isn’t at all superficial to technical work.
    > It’s the whole thing. That which produces it is good work
    > and that which destroys it is bad work. The specs, the
    > measuring instruments, the quality control, the final check-
    > out, these are all means toward the end of satisfying the
    > peace of mind of those responsible for the work. What really > counts in the end is their peace of mind, nothing else. The
    > reason for this is that peace of mind is a prerequisite for
    > a perception of that Quality which is beyond romantic Quality
    > and classic Quality and which unites the two, and which must
    > accompany the work as it proceeds. The way to see what looks
    > good and understand the reasons it looks good, and to be at
    > one with this goodness as the work proceeds, is to cultivate
    > an inner quietness, a peace of mind so that goodness can
    > shine through.
