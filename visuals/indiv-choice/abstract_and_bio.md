# Abstract

This talk is about
“Putting the ‘I’ back in choIce modelling:
Motivations and desiridata for individualized choice models.”
We will investigate why choice modellers might want to turn our modeling efforts
inwards to build models with N=1, how we might do so successfully,
and what we can do with such research afterwards.


# Bio

Dr. Timothy Brathwaite is a data scientist.
He’s most recently worked with Stitch Fix, Inc. and Lyft. Inc.
His research, in the Ph.D and currently, focuses on the intersection between
machine learning, statistics, and discrete choice.
He was the recipient of the 2018 Eric Paz dissertation award
from the International Association for Travel Behavior Research
for his work on these topics.


# Flyer

2020 and 2021 have been harsh.
Pandemics, loss of life, and loss of loved ones in too many forms.
Loss of wealth, health, and home for too many.
The world's collective mental health has been severely challenged,
especially as seen through our ability to make and execute our desired plans
(of all kinds).

Our thoughts, physical feelings, and emotions
all influence the way we plan to and actually do behave.
Come participate in a discussion of
how choice modelling might help us individually
describe, understand, and intervene to alter/control
these influences in ourselves as we all attempt to "get better"
(whether from bad to okay or okay to great) during these hard years.
Questions and comments are greatly appreciated!

I hope to see some of you there.
The crowd will be a mix of
at least psychologists, econometricians, and engineers.
That is, this will be a diverse group, and all backgrounds are welcome.
I hope to be widely accessible.

Additionally, if you work in the fields of mental health service provision,
in any way, it'd be extra useful to hear from you.
This talk sits at the intersection of discrete choice and psychology.
It's an intersection of topics I know much about and topics I know little about.
It'd be great to be nicely corrected by friends
as opposed to meanly corrected by strangers, :).
Come keep me honest!

(And yes. I know. The spelling in my name will be corrected shortly.)
