# Abstract

This talk is about
“Putting the ‘I’ back in choIce modelling:
Motivations and desiridata for individualized choice models.”
We will investigate why choice modellers might want to turn our modeling efforts
inwards to build models with N=1, how we might do so successfully,
and what we can do with such research afterwards.
