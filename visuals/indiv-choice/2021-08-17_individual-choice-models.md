## What is meant by the motivating analogy, in general?

To me, inverted hydra's are a class of problems,
where there are many diverse symptoms of the problem,
and even if you address one or more of these symptoms,
the unfriendly beast remains if you do not address the core of the hydra.

---

## What is meant by the motivating analogy, for this talk in particular?

The hydra's core is problems with our executive function,
that is our ability to **plan** and **execute our plans**---
in choice modelling terms,
our ability to express consistent
**stated** and **revealed** preferences for our lives.

---

## Why is this talk's problem important?

Problematic or undesired executive functioning wreaks havoc on society
and on our lives in particular.

When thoughts, feelings, and emotions become intense enough,
they impact all aspects of our
executive functioning and decision making at the individual level.

Given these far-reaching and profound impacts,
choice-modeller's may benefit from combining our efforts with
people and tools from disciplines that focus directly on the impact of
thoughts, feelings, and emotions, on **indidvidual** choice making.

## Why is this talk's problem important (personally)

- thoughts:
  flashbacks led to inability to execute cooking plans
  in past after stressful breakup.
- physical-feelings:
  knots in stomach before intense high school track workouts
  so I always had to cut the planned warm-up short
  to use the bathroom no matter how little I ate.
- emotional-feelings:
  anxiety over enormity of day's plans leading me to cancel a recent call
  I was looking forward to so much with Joan.

Across the years, it's clear that when considering my own choice making,
the main choice modelling paradigms left much to be desired:
to my great displeasure, my decision making is frequently irrational,
and tools from other disciplines appear most directly helpful in developing
(mental and/or programmable and realistic) models of how I/we each make choices,
despite my background in econometric choice-modelling.

## Why is this talk's problem important (amongst-friends)?

- grief over loss of loved one's and being unable to function as desired.
  completely common, but the individuals themselves say they wish to move on.
- friends being triggered over past eating disorders from observing others
  spontaneously in restaurants.
- friends who are unable to sleep due to increased stress in their lives,
  despite planning to go to sleep or getting in bed to do so.

Here, lots of people seem to wish they had an accurate map/model of how they and
their thoughts/emotions/behaviors worked, such that they could exert greater
control and effective choice in their own lives.

## Why is this talk's problem important (societally)?

- unprecedented pandemic grief

---

## Why is this talk's problem important (societally)?

- terrible migrant conditions
  (e.g. Panama-Colombia crossing through jungle,
  Venezuela-Colombia crossing through la trochas,
  Africa -> Europe migration)
(2 - 3 images on slide, with slide-title?)

---

## Why is this talk's problem important (societally)?

- intense mental health challenges even amongst 1st world
  (e.g. athletes, general worldwide demand up \_\_\_ \%)

---

## Why is this talk's problem important (societally)?

People need help describing, accurately understanding, and intervening on
how they make choices and decisions in their own lives.

As choice modellers we can help people and ourselves DIRECTLY instead of
hoping that our helpful efforts will trickle down
from the governments or companies we typically work with
to the people we actually hope to serve.

---

## How does our problem relate to choice (modelling)?

Psychology and the study of how an individual's mind works to make its choices.

## Recap and call to action

- multi-layered problems with genesis in or effects on individual choice making
- choice modelling/modellers can help
  - describe/observe/baseline,
  - predict (as a coach might,
    to avoid one getting in situations likely to result in undesired outcomes),
  - design interventions for beneficial change
    (as a coach or therapist might, saying,
    if you do this, then this is likely to result)
- to best accomplish any of this, we should collaborate with myriad disciplines
  to build tools that make it into the hands of individuals directly,
  and also into the hands of mental health practitioners working directly
  with people seeking help.
