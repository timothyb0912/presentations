## Thanks

- Choice Modelling Centre at University of Leeds
- Everyone for taking time out of their day to attend or watch this seminar.

---

## What this talk is not about
- quantitative research results
- procedural details of how to estimate individualized choice models

It IS about
- what research we may benefit from doing and
  what models we may benefit from building
- why we might benefit from building individualized choice models

---

## What problem motivates this talk?

An inverted hydra.

---

## What is meant by the motivating analogy, in general?

To me, inverted hydra's are a class of problems,
where there are many diverse symptoms of the problem,
and even if you address one or more of these symptoms,
the unfriendly beast remains if you do not address the core of the hydra.

---

## What is meant by the motivating analogy, for this talk in particular?

The hydra's core is problems with our executive function,
that is our ability to **plan** and **execute our plans**---
in choice modelling terms,
our ability to express consistent
**stated** and **revealed** preferences for our lives.

---

## Why is this talk's problem important?

Problematic or undesired executive functioning wreaks havoc on society
and on our lives in particular.

When thoughts, feelings, and emotions become intense enough,
they impact all aspects of our
executive functioning and decision making at the individual level.

Given these far-reaching and profound impacts,
choice-modeller's may benefit from combining our efforts with
people and tools from disciplines that focus directly on the impact of
thoughts, feelings, and emotions, on **individual** choice making.

---

## Why is this talk's problem important (personally)

- thoughts:
  flashbacks led to inability to execute cooking plans
  in past after stressful breakup.
- physical-feelings:
  knots in stomach before intense high school track workouts
  so I always had to cut the planned warm-up short
  to use the bathroom no matter how little I ate.
- emotional-feelings:
  anxiety over enormity of day's plans leading me to cancel a recent call
  I was looking forward to so much with Joan.

Across the years, it's clear that when considering my own choice making,
the main choice modelling paradigms left much to be desired:
to my great displeasure, my decision making is frequently irrational,
and tools from other disciplines appear most directly helpful in developing
(mental and/or programmable and realistic) models of how I/we each make choices,
despite my background in econometric choice-modelling.

---

## Why is this talk's problem important (amongst-friends)?

- grief over loss of loved one's and being unable to function as desired.
  completely common, but the individuals themselves say they wish to move on.
- friends being triggered over past eating disorders from observing others
  spontaneously in restaurants.
- friends who are unable to sleep due to increased stress in their lives,
  despite planning to go to sleep or getting in bed to do so.

Here, lots of people seem to wish they had an accurate map/model of how they and
their thoughts/emotions/behaviors worked, such that they could exert greater
control and effective choice in their own lives.

## Why is this talk's problem important (societally)?

- unprecedented pandemic grief

---

## Why is this talk's problem important (societally)?

- terrible migrant conditions
  (e.g. Panama-Colombia crossing through jungle,
  Venezuela-Colombia crossing through la trochas,
  Africa -> Europe migration)
(2 - 3 images on slide, with slide-title?)

---

## Why is this talk's problem important (societally)?

- intense mental health challenges even amongst 1st world
  (e.g. athletes, general worldwide demand up \_\_\_ \%)

People AND mental health professionals work in
noisy, highly-complex, data-sparse situations.
These conditions are precisely those where models may be most beneficial for
helping us describe, accurately understand, and intervene on
we make choices and decisions in our-own / our-clients lives.

As choice modellers we can help people and ourselves DIRECTLY instead of
waiting for our helpful efforts to trickle down
from the governments or companies we typically work with
to the people we actually hope to serve.

<!-- It would be great to have two visuals on the slide that remind me of
this slide's two points: that algos are useful in therapeutic/coaching
situations and that modeller's can help directly -->

## How does our problem relate to choices (and the modelling thereof)?

The overlap is the study of how an individual's mind works to make its choices,
especially the choices needed for successful executive functioning.

Specifically, we can model our behaviors
(which are often choices and therapeutic/coaching targets):
- choice of 'outcome' behaviors that are of interest in and of themselves
  (e.g. performing a task for work/school)
- choice of behaviors that affect/cause our emotions and physical feeling
  (e.g. playing music, drawing, dancing, exercising, etc.)
- choice of behaviors that affect/cause our thoughts
  (e.g. questioning ourselves and our choice of question)
- choice of our reactions to spontaneous thoughts, feelings, and events
  (e.g. choice of coping mechanism)

<!-- Perhaps a row that says Behavior (on left) then 4 columns,
     1 column for each choice to be modeled,
     outcome, cause of emotions/feelings, cause of thoughts, reactions,
     with pictures on top -->

---

## What do I mean by choice modelling?

Most broadly, the construction of software programs that takes as input,
a description of a choice situation,
and returns as output, a probability distribution
over the choices an individual might make in that situation.

<!-- make sure everyone has a common, basic understanding. -->
---

## What do I mean by individualized choice modelling?

Choice modelling where the number of people used to create the programs is 1.

---

## Where can choice modellers contribute and collaborate?

- descriptive models (e.g. max likelihood)
- predictive models (e.g. max accuracy)
- causal/structural models
  (e.g. max accuracy on out-of-distribution/experimental data)

---

## What might people and practitioners gain from individualized choice models?
- greater self-monitoring ability / anomaly detection capability
  (i.e. is this working at all? Am I regressing and/or is life just rough?)
- greater prediction ability
  (i.e., what's the likelihood of this run-of-the-mill plan succeeding?)
- greater ability to design novel interventions and
  credibly reason about their effects
  (i.e., how will this new intervention cause/affect the outcome?)

---

## What disciplines of people can choice modellers learn from?
- mental health workers and psychologists,
  as they have rich descriptions and evidence about
  how our minds work to make decisions and plan.
- N=1 researchers from
  - psychology: idiographic methods,
  - computer science: reinforcement learning
  - anthropology and sociology: auto-ethnographers

---

## What tool-building collaborations might choice modellers benefit from?

- N=1 data collectors
  - quantified self movement
  - self-gamification movement
- software and machine learning engineers
  (e.g. for app development and text, audio, and visual data manipulation)
- game developers
- psychological scale creators

---

## How can we avoid causing harm with individualized choice models?
- avoid self-deception, i.e. unrealistic-models
  (note image of narcissus here).
- avoid gaming the of the measures metrics we begin measuring through our models.
- preserving privacy (especially when working with others).

## What publishing venues might see value in such N=1 research?
- self-publish on Github with a DOI as with other academic publications.

---

## What publishing venues might see value in such N=1 research?
- self-publish on Github with a DOI as with other academic publications.
- psychology journals as they have a history of accepting idiographic research

---

## What publishing venues might see value in such N=1 research?
- self-publish on Github with a DOI as with other academic publications.
- psychology journals as they have a history of accepting idiographic research
- choice modelling journals since the research is topical,
  though internal resistance from the field may be high.
  We would benefit from 'boots-on-the-ground' models in addition to current
  models that only operate from the sky,
  pooling and losing the details of thousands of individuals at a time.

---

## Recap and call to action

- multi-layered problems with genesis in or effects on individual choice making
- conditions are such that models are likely to be useful (relative to humans)
  - high-noise to signal ratios
  - high-complexity situations
- choice modelling/modellers can help
  - describe/observe/baseline,
  - predict (as a coach might,
    to avoid one getting in situations likely to result in undesired outcomes),
  - design interventions for beneficial change
    (as a coach or therapist might, saying,
    if you do this, then this is likely to result)
- to best accomplish any of this, we should collaborate with myriad disciplines
  to build tools that make it into the hands of individuals directly,
  and also into the hands of mental health practitioners working directly
  with people seeking help.

## Fin

I've heard it said that because
> an unexamined life is a life not worth living.

that we should seek to "know thyself."

In the course of our self-examinations,
I hope we each develop a detailed understanding of how we make our choices--
i.e., the most fundamental self-knowledge of all.
