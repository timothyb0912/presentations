## Contributing

First, thanks for your interest in this project.
If you'd like to contribute, there are a number of ways.
Feel free to make post issues about the project,
add documentation,
add tests,
or add features.
See [CONTRIBUTING](./CONTRIBUTING.md) for additional guidance.


## Development installation

To work on and edit `presentations`,
the following setup process may be useful.

1. From the project root, create a virtual environment with the name of `presentations`.
2. Activate the new environment.
3. install `presentations` in an editable fashion using:
   ```
   make install
   ```

Now take a look at the `src/presentations`, `scripts` and `notebooks` directories.

## Dependency Management & Reproducibility

1. Always keep your abstract (unpinned) dependencies updated in `requirements.in` and in `pyproject.toml` if you want to ship and install the package via `pip` later on.

   - Use `requirements.in` for dependencies that can be installed via `pip`.
   - Use `pyproject.toml` for dependencies that are needed for `presentations` to function at all, not just in development.
2. Create concrete dependencies as `requirements.txt` for the exact reproduction of your environment with:
   ```
   pip-compile requirements.in
   ```
3. Update your current environment using:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
   if you did not update any non-pip dependencies.
