- I like all of the first four slides.

- I dislike the particular blender picture used, and
  I think I'd prefer a 'flat' icon instead,
  if you do go with a picture of a blender.

- Can you make the font larger for the body of the slides,
  starting on page 6 and following.
  In particular, I have bad eyesight and always struggle when watching the
  presentations of others, so I typically restrict myself to font sizes of 16
  and larger. I've heard from designer friends of mine that they aesthetically
  hate this, but I've appreciated it when viewing recordings of my live talks.

- On page 6, can you change "Choice Modelling Implementation" to
  "Microeconomic Implementation"

- On page 7, can you change from "N = 2" to "N > 2"

- On page 7, can you capitalize the "S" in "statistics?"

- On page 8, can you change "(statistics)" to "(Machine Learning)"

- On page 9, can you change "(statistics)" to "(Causal Inference)"

- On page 9, for the spoon caption, can you change "and Suggesting of" to
  "and suggesting thereof"

- On page 9, for the image of causal graphical models,
  can you remove all text by cropping the image so it only contains the graph?

- On page 13 - 17,
  my initial reaction to the text overlaid atop image backgrounds is very averse.
  I don't like the headings clashing with any images behind it.
  So I like slide 14 the most out of this batch of slides.

  Can you ensure the headings don't have another visual element behind them,
  if you do use an image  background for the slide, and when possible,
  can you err on the side of using full image backgrounds sparingly?
  E.g. I like the recap slide.

- On slide 13, can you consider using a two column layout with the clock image
  on one side, and two bullets on the other, saying "Present usefulness remains"
  and "Future opportunities have become even more important."

- On slides 14 and 15,
  can you try finding visual representations for all bullet ponts.
  I'll likely need them for remembering the details here.

  For instance, for slide 14, I like the broken link image.
  I think an image of a tree with all its leaves on the ground might be
  appropriate for the trees without economic interpretations.
  For the lack of causal graph investigation, perhaps something like the
  following would be good: a red circle with a slash through it,
  next to the causal graph image from slide 9?

  I'll also appreciate short captions such as
  - "No custom links"
  - "Missing econometric interpretations"
  - "Unquestioned graphs, if any"

- On slide 16, for "learn to translate all 3 fields",
  I'm thinking of the following image:
  a square,
  where the edges of the square are double-headed arrows,
  and where each vertex of the square is one of the following words:
  - "Statistics" (top left)
  - "Discrete Choice" (top right)
  - "Causal Inference" (bottom left)
  - "Machine Learning" (bottom right)

  and where there is a double-headed arrow across both diagonals.
  Next to this square could perhaps be a dictionary icon/image.
  Above or below the image pair is the caption / title "Learn and Translate?",
  followed by an arrow pointing at the "ain't nobody got time for that" image.

- On slide 17, can you adopt a two column layout with the image that is
  currently the background on one side, and on the other side, the
  following citation (subtitle not necessary if it takes too much space):
  > "Check yourself before you wreck yourself:
  > Assessing discrete choice models through predictive simulations."
  > Brathwaite, Timothy. (2018)
  > https://arxiv.org/abs/1806.02307
  > https://github.com/timothyb0912/check-yourself

- On slide 18, I'm assuming the arrows simply don't show on pdf?
  If otherwise, can you please add arrows from X -> box -> Y_{obs|sim}

- On slides 19 - 21, please capitalize Frequentist, Computational, and Bayesian.
  (I know I used lowercase in the outline.
  I flip-flopped even then but I will commit now.)

- On slides 19 - 26, can you enlarge the text boxes inside the circle so they
  reach the circle's edge? The goal being to make any text that must be read
  easy to read by even those who are nearsighted.

- On slide 27 can you reduce the width of the train image
  (somehow someway, cropping, scaling, whatever you prefer),
  and replace the map image with a screenshot of the 1st page of this article
  cropping out everything below the authors' names?
  I'll be comparing with one of this paper's models as an example,
  as its a "classic" in our field that everyone is well acquainted with.
  The train image width reduction is so that the paper screenshot won't be
  terribly small.

- On slide 31, can you replace "Recap and Future Directions" with "Fin"?

- Can you insert a slide before slide 31 that has the title
  "Recap and Future Directions", and this time, populate the slide with prior
  images from the presentation:
  - the word, location, and t-shirt icons,
  - the pot, spice, and spoon,
  - soloist + orchestra image
  - a 4-pane red and black checkerboard pattern with a link to
