# Notebooks

Place Jupyter notebooks for this project in this repository.

Place notebooks under version control using [Jupytext](https://jupytext.readthedocs.io/en/latest/install.html).
Save notebooks as both markdown files and as [light](https://jupytext.readthedocs.io/en/latest/formats.html#the-light-format) formatted notebooks.
This facilitates separate linting of one's markdown text,
and testing of one's executable python code.

Start notebooks by copying the provided template.

Use a naming scheme such as `_001_your_notebook_name.ipynb`.
This ensures your Jupytext paired python filename will be compatible with python module specifications.
